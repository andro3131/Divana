  "about": {
    "title": "About Me",
    "bio1": "Maja Marinčič is a singer, born in spring – and that is no coincidence. Her very name carries the energy of awakening, tenderness and new beginnings. Within her lives a powerful intuition that she trusts and follows, and her inner strength is most beautifully expressed through music.",
    "bio2": "Music is not just art for her, but a way of being. It is her medium for expressing the soul, emotions, sincerity and gentleness. But above all stands singing – as a calling. Through her voice, she creates vibrations that connect people, soften hearts and open space for deeper feeling.",
    "bio3": "Singing is a form of therapy for her – and that is exactly what she wants to pass on to her listeners. So that a song awakens your most intimate feelings, memories and everything that often remains unspoken.",
    "bio4": "She has been singing since forever. She began performing publicly in secondary school as a choir member and soloist, later had several solo performances with the Big Band ŠC Novo Mesto and also performed with the AVE orchestra. She participated in the opera choir of the world's first tamburitza opera – V objemu Lahinje and performed with the Tamburitza Orchestra Dobreč.",
    "bio5": "In September 2023, she performed at the Tamburitza Mondovision as part of the World Tamburitza Festival, where she received the award for best female vocal among 15 representatives from 11 countries. She has performed at numerous festivals in Macedonia and Serbia, where she received several festival awards. She also presented her musical journey at an international festival in Kyrgyzstan, where her interpretation left a powerful impression.",
    "bio6": "She has held several solo concerts – including at Žužemberk Castle, STIK Hall and the Cultural Centre Trebnje.",
    "bio7": "As a songwriter and performer, she builds a recognisable, heartfelt musical expression. She has released the songs: Metulja sva, Ta trenutek, Sestro, Prava ženska, Dahni mi and Najdeš spet domov.",
    "bio8": "Her newest musical story carries the signature Maja Marinčič – Divana, with which she steps more clearly into her authentic expression. She also performs with her band, consisting of Gašper Možina, Tilen Omerzel Macedoni, Domen Stražišar and Bogdan Turnšek – together they create powerful concert evenings and fill concert halls.",
    "bio9": "Audiences especially appreciate her exceptional interpretations of covers, which she sings in her own deeply heartfelt and recognisable way.",
    "bio10": "Together with guitarist Gašper Možina, she brings music to life on terraces, creates unforgettable atmospheres at weddings, birthdays, special events and concerts. She also enriches jubilees of small and large companies, public events and grand openings.",
    "bio11": "Maja Marinčič – Divana, through her solo concerts and performances, gently yet powerfully reminds women of their natural, authentic femininity. In doing so, she opens space for deeper relationships, more understanding and more heart – across all generations."
